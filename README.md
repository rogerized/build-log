# 🏗️ rogerized — Build Log

Optimizing for **decision clarity** and **learning velocity** over noise, reach, and scale.

- **Time constraint:** max. 4–6 hours/week  
- **Philosophy:** small systems, bootstrapped execution, zero performative building  
- **Goal:** identify the smallest artifact that produces a signal

This repository is a thinking tool, not a marketing channel.

## 🤝 Sparring & Exchange

I'm open to a **bi-weekly 30-minute sparring exchange**.

- **Who:** builders/founders working on idea validation, lean MVPs, and bootstrapping  
- **What I offer:** honest feedback + ~20 years online-biz experience (multi co-founder, PM/CTO background)  
- **Format:** calm, focused, agenda-light  
- **Interested:** DM or email (link intentionally omitted)

Optional and non-urgent.

## ⚡ Current Focus

- **Domain:** decision support & complexity reduction  
- **Sprint intent:** test whether *decision confidence* is a real, felt pain  
- **Kill rule:** if signal stays weak for ~8 weeks, this branch gets closed

## 📓 Build Log (weekly)

### 2026-W06

- **Learning:** "Build-log" as a thinking tool clarified (repo used for signal + decision discipline, not marketing)

### 2026-W03
- **Shipped:** Schema/seeds finalized + seed version bumped; single system template established and expanded (attributes, official CTA, specs table, caption support, readability/layout cleanup) (987e11b, d35137c, 78621df, 9b174b8, 66b7801, 0374193, f1dcb1d, c7fb400, 7b1b985, 7b5a5da)

- **Shipped:** Refactored all to plugin; brand taxonomy change landed (6ec1b10, 5ca7e87)

### 2026-W01
- **Shipped:** Setup repo, new IDE's and workflow to work more efficiently on furniture decision platform

## Build Log Labels (canonical)

- **Decision:** A committed choice (scope, channel, rule).
- **Test:** The smallest next action to generate real-world signal.
- **Shipped:** What exists now (artifact delivered, even tiny).
- **Signal:** What reality said (usage, replies, numbers, behavior).
- **Learning:** What changed in your thinking because of signal.
- **Next:** The next concrete step (one move, not a wishlist).

---

## ❓ Unresolved
*Uncertainty, not tasks.*

- What a convincing early signal of *decision confidence* looks like is still unclear  
- Audience signal quality (solo founders vs PMs) is not yet obvious  
- Kill criteria exists conceptually, but is not yet operationalized

---

## 🪦 Idea Graveyard
*Failure is treated as high-quality signal.*

| Project / Idea       | Date Killed | Reason                    | Key Learning |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Example Project**  | 2026-01-20  | Exceeded time constraints | Stack too heavy for an MVP |

Entries here are considered progress.

---

## 🚧 Guardrails

- **Sustainable pace:** 4–6 hours/week is a hard limit  
- **Zero performance:** no building-in-public for attention  
- **Relentless reduction:** kill early rather than maintain zombie projects  
- **Asset bias:** every hour should yield a reusable insight or technical asset

If this repo ever feels heavy, it will be simplified.

## 📍 Status

**Active.**  
Updated irregularly, when meaningful decisions or learnings occur.  
Progress is measured by clarity gained, not activity volume.
